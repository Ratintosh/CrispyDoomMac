Crispy Doom Launcher for MacOS.

### Downloads
You can download the latest version of the launcher [here](https://github.com/foxxgaming/CrispyDoomMac/releases/tag/2.0.0)

Should run straight out of the box! Shouldn't be any different from Chocolate Doom, just with the Crispy Doom settings!

(ARCHIVED)
If you still insist on using v1.0.0 for some reason, heres how to install it. 

This launcher will require some dependencies to run, so you cant just run the .app file right of the bat. The file comes bundled with an installer binary. Simply double click it to start the installation.
*If terminal doesn't open when you double-click it, open Terminal and type "chmod +x " and drag the installer file into terminal. Press enter and then try to double-click the installer.*

If the installer doesn't work, make sure you have **git** installed.
