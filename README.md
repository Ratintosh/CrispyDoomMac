# CrispyDoomMac
Crispy Doom Port for MacOS.
(If you need support you can contact me on Discord via SpaceRat#6734)
*Tested on MacOS 10.15 Catalina*

### Downloads
You can download the latest version of the launcher [here](https://github.com/foxxgaming/CrispyDoomMac/releases/latest)

It **should** run straight out of the box without installing any extra dependencies, but if it doesn't you can install version 2.0.0 [here](https://github.com/foxxgaming/CrispyDoomMac/wiki/Downloading-Version-2.0.0)

The wiki contains a small little tutorial on how to install 2.0.0 properly to get you on your feet.


**If by any means version 2.0.5 doesn't work, please let me know by creating a new issue.**
